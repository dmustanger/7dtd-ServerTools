Fixed invalid item checker to look for anyone listed greater in number on the admin list than has been set in the servertools config option
Invalid items setup example: Setting 4 on the servertools config will check for all admins, mods, and players level 5 and higher for invalid items. Setting 2 would check 
anyone 3 or higher from the admin list
Fixed /reserved command and /doncolor giving improper responses when the reservedslots function is turned off
Set higher defaults for donator levels to avoid conflicts with existing admin tiers

Updates to the colored chat system in future versions are coming

v.4.5
Added auto restart system. This is technically a shutdown. Performs shutdown with countdown by calling on stopserver command. To restart your server automatically, set it as
a service in windows OS or make sure your server provider you rent from has an auto restart feature enabled before using this feature. If this is not available to you, you
will need to manually reboot your server after each shutdown. Setting is default off.
Servertools can not restart a server automatically because it is only loaded when the server is running

v.4.4
*REQUIRES COPPIS MOD FOR ANIMAL TRACKING*
Fixed donator chat color. Admin can change the level and donators can still activate their chat color at will or switch between them
Fixed /reserved command not working when doncolor was turned off
